These measuring tools, which individuals are more likely to have at home, might be able to flag individuals with an increased risk of hypertension.\n","\n","[Researchers in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/637635) collected data from several hundred college students in order to answer this question. We will be specifically using the data they collected from female students.\n","\n","The measurements we have are:\n","\n","* Age (age in years)\n","* BMI (body mass index, a ratio of weight to height)\n","* WC (waist circumference in centimeters)\n","* HC (hip circumference in centimeters)\n","* WHR (waist-hip ratio)\n","* SBP (systolic blood pressure)\n","\n","The chart below describes various blood pressure values:\n","\n","<a title=\"Ian Furst, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hypertension_ranges_chart.png\"><img width=\"512\" alt=\"Hypertension ranges chart\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Hypertension_ranges_chart.png/512px-Hypertension_ranges_chart.png\"></a>\n","\n","### Requirements\n","\n","#### 1. Perform a Train-Test Split\n","\n","Load the data into a dataframe using pandas, separate the features (`X`) from the target (`y`), and use the `train_test_split` function to separate data into training and test sets.\n","\n","#### 2. Build and Evaluate a First Simple Model\n","\n","Using the `LinearRegression` model and `mean_squared_error` function from scikit-learn, build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using the training data. Also, use `cross_val_score` to simulate unseen data, without actually using the holdout test set.\n","\n","#### 3. Use `PolynomialFeatures` to Reduce Underfitting\n","\n","Apply a `PolynomialFeatures` transformer to give the model more ability to pick up on information from the training data. Test out different polynomial degrees until you have a model that is perfectly fit to the training data.\n","\n","#### 4. Use Regularization to Reduce Overfitting\n","\n","Instead of a basic `LinearRegression`, use a `Ridge` regression model to apply regularization to the overfit model. In order to do this you will need to scale the data. Test out different regularization penalties to find the best model.\n","\n","#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n","\n","Preprocess `X_test` and `y_test` appropriately in order to evaluate the performance of your final model on unseen data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 1. Perform a Train-Test Split\n","\n","Before looking at the text below, try to remember: why is a train-test split the *first* step in a machine learning process?\n","\n","---\n","\n","<details>\n","    <summary style=\"cursor: pointer\"><b>Answer (click to reveal)</b></summary>\n","\n","A machine learning (predictive) workflow fundamentally emphasizes creating *a model that will perform well on unseen data*. We will hold out a subset of our original data as the \"test\" set that will stand in for truly unseen data that the model will encounter in the future.\n","\n","We make this separation as the first step for two reasons:\n","\n","1. Most importantly, we are avoiding *leakage* of information from the test set into the training set. Leakage can lead to inflated metrics, since the model has information about the \"unseen\" data that it won't have about real unseen data. This is why we always want to fit our transformers and models on the training data only, not the full dataset.\n","2. Also, we want to make sure the code we have written will actually work on unseen data. If we are able to transform our test data and evaluate it with our final model, that's a good sign that the same process will work for future data as well.\n","    \n","</details>\n","\n","\n","### Loading the Data\n","\n","In the cell below, we import the pandas library and open the full dataset for you.
